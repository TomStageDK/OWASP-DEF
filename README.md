OWASP DEF (Data Exchange Format Project)

`OWASP Data Exchange Format` - https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Data_Exchange_Format_Project - http://code.google.com/p/owasp-def/

This is a draft project for the above, and this is WORK IN PROGRESS.

The goal of this draft is to come up with an Data Exchange Format that should be able to hold almost any Penetration test software output, whether this is
Dynamic, Static, Information gathering or Attack / Brute force.

This is based on the initial work done by Simon Bennetts (Psiinon) Zed Attack Proxy Project Leader and  Dinis Cruz O2 Platform Project Leader, 
and a lot of input from Dan Cornell and the guys behind Threadfix and the SSVL format.

Further information can be found at the above links.

Involvement is encouraged, so if you would like to contribute to this project then please join the mailing list (https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-data-exchange-format).

I fully intend on this format being a part of OWASP.

The reason this draft lives here is only out of convenience for me.
